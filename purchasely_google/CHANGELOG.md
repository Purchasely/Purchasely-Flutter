## 4.0.0
üö® Important: This SDK version uses StoreKit 2 by default unless you have not setup credential for SK2 in Purchasely console.
üöß Important: Documentation for this release is in progress and will be available in early September. Some methods and properties have undergone changes. Detailed information will follow soon.
### Google Play Billing v5 Integration
Version: Purchasely SDK 4.0.0 now integrates with Google Play Billing v5 (5.2.1). This ensures you have access to the comprehensive features introduced in the latest version of Google's in-app subscriptions.
Action Required: Review your plans on the Purchasely console to confirm the presence of a basePlan identifier.
### StoreKit 2 by default
On iOS devices running with iOS 15+, Purchasely SDK uses StoreKit 2 by default.
Please, follow our documentation to upload your private key and do all necessary steps for StoreKit 2 on Purchasely console.
### Promo Offers (Exclusive for Google and Apple)
New Feature: Excitingly, we're introducing support for promotional offers on AppStore Connect and developer determined offers on Google Play Console.
Action Required: When setting up your developer determined offers in the Google Play Console, make sure to tag them as "ignore-offer". This ensures that the Purchasely SDK doesn't automatically apply them to all your paywalls. Instead, they'll be used exclusively where you've specified.
### iOS Eligibility Management
Streamlined and restructured for products, providing a more coherent and optimized experience.
### Presentation lifecycle handling
- `Purchasely.hidePresentation()` to hide a paywall.
- `Purchasely.showPresenttation()` to display hidden paywall.
- `Purchasely.closePresentation()` to close definitely paywall displayed (needs to call fetchPresentation to display it again).
### Is Anonymous
Add method `Purchasely.isAnonymous()`: Promise<boolean> to know if your user is currently anonymous or not for Purchasely.
